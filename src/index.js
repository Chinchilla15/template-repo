/*
Welcome to the my template rep. Repo includes webpack configuration with cli and server included, ESlint and Prettier configuration (following the airbnb style guide).

The following configurations are added in VSCode settings so that Prettier and ESlint are applied to your documents on save:
{
  "editor.defaultFormatter": "esbenp.prettier-vscode",
  "eslint.probe": ["javascript", "javascriptreact"],
  "editor.formatOnSave": false,
  // Runs Prettier, then ESLint
  "editor.codeActionsOnSave": ["source.formatDocument", "source.fixAll.eslint"]
}
You can remove or chage this setting in the settings.json file by going yo Preferences: Open Workspace Settings (JSON)

Note: ESlint has some rules applied already, you can check the .eslint.json file and modify it as you wish. 

Happy coding!
